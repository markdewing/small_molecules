The `he.inp` file is a very minimal input file for GAMESS.

* Comment lines start with `!`
* Control lines start with a space and then `$`. (Sometimes a problem when uncommenting some of the lines)

The `he_ext.inp' file specifies the basis set in the input file, rather than using one of the internal sets.
